# ðŸ¤– Kotlin ML Model Serving Server

A Kotlin-based Ktor microservice designed to serve ML predictions in real time. This server acts as a bridge between your ML models (hosted locally or remotely via REST/gRPC) and any client application. You can easily extend it to support multiple models, perform A/B testing, or integrate a model registry. Ideal for AI-driven web backends with Kotlin! ðŸš€

## âœ¨ Project Highlights

- Kotlin + Ktor REST microservice  
- Flexible to connect with remote ML models over REST or gRPC  
- Easily manage multiple models and A/B testing routes  
- JSON-based payloads for input/output  
- Fully asynchronous with coroutine support  
- Production-grade error handling

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kotlin-ml-serving-server.git
```

2. **Run the server**  
```bash
./gradlew run
```

3. Test the prediction endpoint with tools like `Postman` or `curl`.

## ðŸ“Œ Endpoints

- `POST /predict/modelA`  
  Calls the ModelA prediction service  
- `POST /predict/modelB`  
  Calls the ModelB prediction service (for A/B testing)

## ðŸ›  Next Features

- Add JWT authentication  
- Integrate Prometheus metrics  
- Support hot model reloading  

## ðŸ“· Example Requests

```json
POST /predict/modelA
{
  "feature1": 1.5,
  "feature2": 3.2
}
```

returns

```json
{
  "prediction": "positive"
}
```
